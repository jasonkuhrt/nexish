# nexish

A minimalist reimplementation of [Nexus](https://github.com/prisma-labs/nexus) by [@tgriesser](https://github.com/tgriesser).

I created this to help myself learn Nexus which I am currently working on in collaboration with Tim and my colleagues ([@Weakky](https://github.com/Weakky)) at Prisma Labs. Trying to reimplement Nexus helps give me a deeper appreciation and understanding for the system. I am also curious how simple I can make the implementaiton and if I can lift a few restrictions we're currently hitting while trying to introduce plugins into Nexus.
